This simulates multiple choice tests and shows the probability of what you would score on a given test if you only give one answer or randomize your choices per question. For example, giving A for all questions.

### Findings
This result was expected.

You can expect to get a score of 1/number_of_choices on a test if you answer the same thing for every question, the same applies to if you pick a random answer for every question.

The more questions on the test, the more likely this holds true.

And as expected, the probability of passing (score > 50%) is incredibly low.
