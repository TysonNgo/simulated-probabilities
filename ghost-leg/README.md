Based on the simulations, it appears that the probability of a selected line's destination given random placement of legs (horizontal connecting lines) is a normal distribution. The peak of the distribution represents an equivalent start and destination line.

We can observe that as the number of legs increases, the spread of the distribution increase.

Even with the number of legs being over 100 times the number of lines, we can see that the normal distribution still exists.
